# Fully Observable
All the sensors can always see the entire environment state

#Partially Observable
Not Fully Observable, the history of the sensors inputs can help us understand the environment

#Environment
What the sensors could observe

#Intelligent Agent (Agent)
The program which is using AI

#Perception Action Cylcle
The repeating cycle of the agent using it's sensors and actuators

#Deterministic Environment
Non Random - actuator action determines the environment

#Stochastic Environment
Randomness involved

#Discrete Environment
Finite number of options

#Continuous Environment
Infinite number of options

#Benign Environment
Random Events

#Adversarial Environments
Actively Working against the Agent
