#Intelligent Agent (Agent)
The program which is using AI

#Perception Action Cylcle
The repeating cycle of the agent using it's sensors and actuators

#Environment
What the sensors could observe

##Types of Environment

### Fully vs Partially Observable
All the sensors can always see the entire environment state vs The history of the sensors inputs can help us understand the environment

###Deterministic vs Stochastic Environment
Non-Random vs Randomness involved

###Discrete vs Continuous Environment
Finite vs Infinite number of options

###Benign vs Adversarial Environment
Random Events vs Actively Working against the Agent

| Partially Observable | Stochastic | Continuous | Adversarial |
